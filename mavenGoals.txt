These are all the goals i needed to build, test, packaging, javadoc and test reporting:

mvn test - compiles test code, runs the JUnit tests and creates test reports in target/surefire-reports
mvn clean - cleans the project (deletes target/) for a fresh build
mvn package - compiles, test and creates .jar
mvn javadoc:javadoc - creates HTML Javadoc in target/site/apidocs/

build (in this instance when it's only a small school project):
mvn clean package - build project and creates .JAR-file (clean -> compiles -> tests -> packs .jar)
